### FactoryTalk Optix Example

I recently went to a FactoryTalk Optix class, which was a walkthrough of their "My First Project" document.  I wanted to test Optix
with git so I'm walking through the document here. In the Optix version Iâ€™m using (1.3.3), I'm not a fan of the git integration so I'm managing
git myself via PowerShell.
